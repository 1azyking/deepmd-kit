There are other specific wont-help type issues for you to choose. If none suit your need, then check other questions.

We will check each issue solved (The problem is solved), running (We are on it.), later (We will fix it in the next version), wontfix (We might fix it in the future), invalid (What you reported is not actually a bug) or duplicate (The question has been asked before) regularly.
